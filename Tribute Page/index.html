        <div id="tribute-info">
            <p>Her name is Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace. She was born on 10 December 1815 and died on 27
                November 1852. She was an English mathematician and writer, mostly known for her work on Charles
                Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to
                recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first
                algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first
                computer programmer.</p>

            <p>It was her mother who immersed her in mathematics. Lady Byron, herself a mathematical wiz called
                “Princess of Parallelograms” by Lord Byron, believed a rigorous course of study rooted in logic and
                reason would enable her daughter to avoid the romantic ideals and moody nature of her father. From the
                age of 4, Lovelace was tutored in mathematics and science, an unusual course of study for a woman in
                19th-century England.</p>
            <p> At the age of 12, Lovelace conceptualized a flying machine. After studying the anatomy of birds and the
                suitability of various materials, the young girl illustrated plans to construct a winged flying
                apparatus before moving on to think about powered flight. “I have got a scheme,” she wrote to her
                mother, “to make a thing in the form of a horse with a steam engine in the inside so contrived as to
                move
                an immense pair of wings, fixed on the outside of the horse, in such a manner as to carry it up into the
                air while a person sits on its back.”</p>
            <p class="medium-title" id="contributions">Contributions</p>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>Her contributions to computing weren’t recognized until a century after her death. Lovelace’s ideas about
                computing were so far ahead of their time that it took nearly a century for technology to catch up.
                While Lovelace’s notes on Babbage’s analytical engine gained little attention at the time they were
                originally published in 1843, they found a much wider audience when republished in B.V. Bowden’s 1953
                book “Faster Than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines.” As the field of computer science
                dawned in the 1950s, Lovelace gained a new following in the digital age.</p>
            <p class="small-title">Predictions about the future</p>
            <p>She was a visionary who predicted that computers could do more than just crunch numbers. Lovelace foresaw
                the multi-purpose functionality of the modern computer. Although Babbage believed the use of his
                machines was confined to numerical calculations, she mused that any piece of content—including music,
                text, pictures and sounds—could be translated to digital form and manipulated by machine. Lovelace wrote
                that the analytical engine “might act upon other things besides number, were objects found whose mutual
                fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations… Supposing, for
                instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical
                composition were susceptible of [mathematical] expression and adaptations, the engine might compose
                elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent."</p>
            <p class="small-title">Ada, the programming language</p>
            <p>A computer programming language is named in Lovelace’s honor. During the 1970s, the U.S. Department of
                Defense developed a high-order computer programming language to supersede the hundreds of different ones
                then in use by the military. When U.S. Navy Commander Jack Cooper suggested naming the new language
                “Ada” in honor of Lovelace in 1979, the proposal was unanimously approved. Ada is still used around the
                world today in the operation of real-time systems in the aviation, health care, transportation,
                financial, infrastructure and space industries.</p>

            <p>
                Charles Dickens read a passage from one of his novels to Lovelace on her deathbed. Dickens and Lovelace
                likely met through Babbage in the 1830s, and the mathematician occasionally attended dinners at the
                writer’s
                London home. As Lovelace suffered from uterine cancer in August 1852, the famed British novelist visited
                his
                bed-ridden friend and, at her request, read a well-known scene from his popular 1848 novel “Dombey and
                Son”
                in which 6-year-old boy Paul Dombey dies. Three months later, Lovelace passed away on November 27, 1852.
